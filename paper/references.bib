  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association, in conjunction with
               the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most
               up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and
               cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors
               (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health
               factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that
               contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update
               presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and
               circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital
               heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis,
               coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous
               disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated
               outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic
               costs). METHODS: The American Heart Association, through its
               Epidemiology and Prevention Statistics Committee, continuously
               monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and
               stroke in the United States to provide the most current
               information available in the annual Statistical Update with
               review of published literature through the year before writing.
               The 2023 Statistical Update is the product of a full year's
               worth of effort in 2022 by dedicated volunteer clinicians and
               scientists, committed government professionals, and American
               Heart Association staff members. The American Heart Association
               strives to further understand and help heal health problems
               inflicted by structural racism, a public health crisis that can
               significantly damage physical and mental health and perpetuate
               disparities in access to health care, education, income,
               housing, and several other factors vital to healthy lives. This
               year's edition includes additional COVID-19 (coronavirus disease
               2019) publications, as well as data on the monitoring and
               benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, with an
               enhanced focus on health equity across several key domains.
               RESULTS: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses
               on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke
               statistics. CONCLUSIONS: The Statistical Update represents a
               critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media
               professionals, clinicians, health care administrators,
               researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best
               available data on these factors and conditions.",
