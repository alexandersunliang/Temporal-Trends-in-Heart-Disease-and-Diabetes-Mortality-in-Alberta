## Overview

This repo features a study on the effects of heart disease and diabetes on mortality rates in Alberta using a Poisson model and a negative binomial model from 2016-2021.

The study was accomplished partly with code taken from Telling Stories with Data (Alexander, 2023). The analysis was conducted through Rstudio using "R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31)


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `paper.qmd` contains the fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Chat-GPT4. Several errors were fixed with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in other/llm/usage.txt.
